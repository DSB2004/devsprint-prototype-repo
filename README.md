# Introduction to the Problem

With the steady rise in the population of senior citizens in India, ensuring adequate care and regular health checks for their physical and mental well-being becomes a critical concern. While some older adults have the support of families and friends, many who are alone at home or in old age homes lack such care and attention.

The increasing numbers highlight the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to address the challenges faced by older adults, including issues related to physical and mental health, as well as concerns about abuse and neglect in some care settings.

# Solution to this Problem
To solve this problem, we have several steps that we can implement to improve their care in institutions and at their homes:

- Social activities like group discussions on politics, spirituality, and other major topics of interest.
- Trips to religious and public places.
- Medical checkups and medication support.
- Yoga and fitness discussions.
- Social events like karaoke competitions, painting, and any kind of art form they could perform.
- Technical skills like the basics of computation, video editing, net surfing, and basic usage of computer applications.
- Providing jobs.
- Legal help for those in need.

## Legal Aid

We will be educating and helping elderly people by introducing them to major government policies that can help them in getting benefits like pensions and social claims from the government, which they, by law, own. Also, our solution involves providing legal aid to those who have faced injustice or violence at any place due to their age. This would, in turn, help them in getting justice for their suffering and can also help in reducing domestic violence and discrimination against old age people.

## Government Policies Involved
We will be considering several government policies listed below to aid old age people:

### Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP)

IPOP is a welfare scheme launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to improve the quality of life of older persons in India. It includes various components such as providing basic amenities, healthcare services, and recreational activities for older adults.

### Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007

This legislation aims to ensure the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens by providing legal recourse for elderly individuals who are neglected or mistreated by their family members. It mandates children and relatives to provide maintenance to their elderly parents or face legal consequences.

### National Programme for the Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE)

NPHCE is a health initiative launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to address the healthcare needs of older adults in India. It focuses on providing comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative services, through primary healthcare facilities.

### Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)

SCSS is a savings scheme specifically designed for individuals aged 60 years and above. It offers a high rate of interest and tax benefits, making it an attractive investment option for older adults looking to secure their financial future.

# Technical View of the Solution
We propose building a platform that would be responsible for providing such facilities like:

- 24x7 assistance via chat and call.
- Easy-to-use UI so that everyone can use it.
- Support for multiple languages.
- Features like voice description for blind people.
- Tutorials for the usage of the application.
- A separate section for all activities with proper descriptions and guidance videos.
- AI-generated chatbot which can interact with users to solve in-app issues (Multi-language support).
- A separate section for legal aid.
- Section in the application to educate old age people about their rights and government policies that can benefit them.

# Summary

Our solution addresses the growing concern of caring for India's elderly population by implementing a range of activities and services to support their physical, mental, and social well-being. Through social engagement activities, medical support, job opportunities, and legal aid, we aim to empower older adults and improve their quality of life. By integrating existing government policies and leveraging technology, our platform ensures accessible and user-friendly assistance, promoting active aging and fostering a sense of community among older adults.
